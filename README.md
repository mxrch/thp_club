# The Hacking Project - Club


## :mag: The content
In these exercises, I had to make **a club site** where users can see other registered users, but can not modify or delete them, **except his own profile**.

I also had to make tests with rspec.


**The live version : http://mxrch-club.herokuapp.com/**

**After cloning the repository, make sure to do :**
```sh
$ cd thp_club
$ bundle install
```

This will install all the dependencies needed for the exercises.
